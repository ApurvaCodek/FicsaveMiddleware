# FicsaveMiddleware

This is a wrapper around the ficsave.xyz website. 
Opening the website, entering the url, choosing options can become tedious after you've read your 100th fic.

Here, you can just share the url of a fic with this app, and you'd be able to do with it as per your defined settings.
* You can set the default format for your fic beforehand, so that everytime you share a fic, that format is used
* You can choose to send email or download the fic by default beforehand.
* After download, you can choose to send it as attachment to someone or your kindle from your own email address instead of choosing the feature provided on ficsave.xyz

## Current Features
* Sharing url works.
* by default, it downloads the fic to Documents folder in MOBI format.
